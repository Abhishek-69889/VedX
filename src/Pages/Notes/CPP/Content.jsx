      "title": "Basics of C++",
      "content": "C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language that supports object-oriented, procedural, and generic programming. It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C language. The first step in learning C++ includes setting up the development environment (like installing Code::Blocks or using online compilers) and understanding the structure of a simple C++ program, which includes headers, the main function, and syntax for input/output.",

    {
      "id": "data-types",
      "title": "Data Types & Variables",
      "content": "Data types in C++ define the type of data a variable can hold. Common data types include int, float, double, char, and bool. Variables are containers used to store values. You must declare a variable before using it by specifying its data type, like 'int age = 25;'. C++ is statically typed, so variable types must be declared explicitly. Constants can be defined using the 'const' keyword to make variables immutable.",

    },
    {
      "id": "operators",
      "title": "Operators",
      "content": "Operators in C++ are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. The main types include: Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.), Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=), Logical operators (&&, ||, !), and Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>). Understanding operator precedence and associativity is important for evaluating expressions correctly.",

    },
    {
      "id": "control-flow",
      "title": "Control Flow (if, loops, switch)",
      "content": "Control flow structures allow decision-making and repetitive execution in C++. Conditional statements include 'if', 'if-else', and 'if-else if' for branching logic. The 'switch' statement is useful when comparing a variable against multiple constant values. Loops include 'for', 'while', and 'do-while' â€” used for repeating code blocks a certain number of times or while a condition holds true. Break and continue statements help in controlling loop execution flow.",

    {
      "id": "functions",
      "title": "Functions",
      "content": "Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and help in code reusability and modularity. In C++, a function is defined with a return type, name, and optional parameters. Example: 'int add(int a, int b)'. Functions can return values or be void (no return value). They can also be overloaded (same name, different parameters). C++ also supports default arguments and recursion. The 'main()' function is the entry point of any C++ program.",

    {
      "id": "arrays-strings",
      "title": "Arrays & Strings",
      "content": "Arrays in C++ are used to store multiple values of the same type in a single variable. They have fixed size and zero-based indexing. Syntax: 'int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};'. Strings in C++ can be managed using either character arrays (C-style) or the 'string' class from the Standard Library. C-style strings are null-terminated character arrays, while the 'string' class offers more functionality like length(), substr(), and concatenation using '+'.",
      "link": "https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/cpp_arrays.asp"
    },
    {
      "id": "pointers",
      "title": "Pointers",
      "content": "Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are a powerful feature in C++ that allow dynamic memory management, efficient array handling, and complex data structures like linked lists. Syntax: 'int *ptr = &var;'. You can access the value at the address using the dereference operator '*'. Pointers can be incremented/decremented to move through memory and are heavily used in functions for pass-by-reference and in dynamic memory allocation.",

    },
    {
      "id": "dynamic-memory",
      "title": "Dynamic Memory Allocation",
      "content": "Dynamic memory in C++ is allocated using the 'new' operator and deallocated using 'delete'. This allows allocation of memory at runtime instead of compile time. Example: 'int* ptr = new int;'. For arrays: 'int* arr = new int[10];'. It's important to free dynamically allocated memory to avoid memory leaks using 'delete' (for single variables) or 'delete[]' (for arrays). Smart pointers introduced in C++11 help manage memory automatically.",
